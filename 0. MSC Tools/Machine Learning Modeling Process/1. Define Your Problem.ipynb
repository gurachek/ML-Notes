    "Create an informal and formal description to really nail down what aspects of a model are your end goal. What resources you have, What is your end goal for prediction?\n",

    "Need a Task for a classifier to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Need an EXPERIENCE that your model can learn from (ie a dataset). Exposure to the experience will make your model better at the task.\n",

    "This is more of a mental exercise that might mimic the thought process of a particular model. What information might be useful. How would you hard code an answer to this?\n",
